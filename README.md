# US Government Debt Analysis Project

## Project Overview
**Client:** US Government / Washington DC Debt Agency  

I was hired by a boutique debt agency in Washington DC specializing in analyzing and forecasting public and private debt. The US Government requested a specific analysis of their public and governmental debt to understand historical trends, seasonal fluctuations, and future growth projections.

## Objectives
The analysis focused on answering three key strategic questions:
1. What was the **Yearly Debt Percentage Increase** for each year compared to the previous year?
2. Which **months** historically have seen the highest and lowest increases in Total Debt?
3. What is the **projected growth** of the publicly held debt in the next few years?

## Data Dictionary
The analysis utilized the following debt classifications:

| Term | Definition |
*| **Debt Held by the Public** | The portion of the US public debt held by individuals, corporations, foreign governments, and entities outside the US government. |
*| **Intragovernmental Holdings** | The portion of the US public debt held by other US government agencies (e.g., Social Security Trust Fund). |
*| **Total Public Debt Outstanding** | The sum of the Debt Held by the Public and Intragovernmental Holdings. |

## Key Findings & Conclusions

### 1. Yearly Debt Trends & Anomalies
**Question:** What was the Yearly Debt Percentage Increase for each year compared to the previous year?

* **2015–2019 Stability:** The average increase in Total Public Debt Outstanding was consistently around **5%**.
* **2020 Impact:** The data shows a significant spike in 2020. This anomaly correlates directly with the economic response to the global pandemic, necessitating increased government borrowing.

### 2. Seasonality and Monthly Fluctuations
**Question:** Which months historically have seen the highest/lowest increases in Total debt?

* **High-Debt Months:** Historically, the highest increases occur in **January, February, November, and December**.
* **Low-Debt Months:** The lowest increases occur in **April, May, June, and July**.
* **Analysis:** The data suggests a correlation with the US holiday season (Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's). The hypothesis suggests that increased spending pressures during the holidays drive debt accumulation, whereas the mid-year months (lacking major gifting holidays) see a contraction or slowing of debt accumulation.

### 3. Future Projections (Publicly Held Debt)
**Question:** What is the projected growth of the publicly held debt in the next few years?

* **Historical Context:**
    * **1997–2007:** Debt increased by approximately **$1 Trillion**.
    * **2008–2019:** Debt surged from **$6 Trillion to $17 Trillion** (a $11T increase over 11 years).
    * **2020–2022:** Debt increased from **$21.5 Trillion to $25 Trillion**.
* **Projection (2023–2027):** Publicly held debt is projected to reach **$33 Trillion** by 2027.
* **Conclusion:** Publicly Held debt is projected to continue increasing at a steady, elevated rate over the next 5 years.

## Tools Used
* **Microsoft Excel:** Data cleaning, pivot tables, and time-series analysis.
* **Forecasting:** Trend line analysis for 2023–2027 projections.
